# MEAN-template
**A simple (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) application template that works.**

This simple template is meant to be used as a starting point for your next super-big MEAN Aplication. It is very easy to run and the comments should make every line of code I've written understandable (if not, feel free to propose changes ðŸ˜‰). It uses a minimum number of npm packages that are crucial to make the application work. Used packages are described below.

### Downloaded from npm

+ **express**: *Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application
framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.*
+ **mongoose**: *Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to
model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation,
query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.*
+ **path**: *The path module provides utilities for working with file and
directory paths.*


### Folder structure

+ **/src**: *Angular app created using ```angular/cli```.*
+ **/repo**: *Contains mongoose Schemas*
+ **/server**: *Files to be used on server-side*
    * **/routes**: *Declared routes to be imported on ```index.js```*
+ **/license**: *Feel free to use. Repo comes with MIT license* ðŸ˜Ž
+ **/index.js**: *File that is used to start the node server*


### Usage

+ Prerequisites
    + **[Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**: *Please be sure you have installed Node.js and npm module on your computer before running the application*
    + **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)**: *Download & Install MongoDB, and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).*
    + **[AngularCLI](https://cli.angular.io/)**: *Is used to build front-end application.*
+ Be sure you have started MongoDB service before running the application
+ Navigate on project folder
+ Run ```ng build``` to generate Angular necessary files. Output files are by default created on ```/dist``` subfolder
+ Now run ```node index.js``` This is the last step and if everything goes right, the server will start listening for requests
+ You can open your browser and navigate to localhost:3000 to see if the application works
